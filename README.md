# Python final-project
## final project repository

**Team memebers:** 
1. John 
2. Timothy 
3. Rushi 


### This Repo has been set up to showcase the individual and combined work of the three team memebers

1. **Each team member has their own branch with the Master branch**
2. **The master branch consists of the final submission**
3. **The final submission is a product of individual .py files**


### Phase one 
1. Replace ? by NaN in column A7. 
- T
2. After replacing - your column needs to be converted back to numeric. Apply pandas function pd.to_numeric() for column A7
- J
3. Report how many NaN. Use isnull() function applied to the dataframe. Then you can use arithmetic sum(). 
- R
4. Replace NaN values with the mean of column A7. Use fillna() - find how to calculate mean of the column, add a parameter skipna=TRUE. 
- T
5. Provide the summary statistics - you can use describe() function
- J
6. Find number of columns and number of rows - hint use 
- R
7. Report how many unique id values (column Scn) - hint the length of unique ids
- T
8. Draw a bar plot for CLASS 
- T
9. Draw a scatterplot of any two columns
- J
10. Summarize by reporting which values might need standardization in the future 
- R
